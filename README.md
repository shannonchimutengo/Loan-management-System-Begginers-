*This project was developed using java programming lunguage and however most of the code was written using imperative programming.

**Imperative programming** is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on
